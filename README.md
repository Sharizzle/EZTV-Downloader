# EZTV Downloader

The purpose of this script was to utilize the EZTV API to download the highest quality torrents by comparing the file sizes from the results generated by the EZTV API, once a season and episode is chosen by the user. This API first connects to the OMDB API when it is given a name of a show, which will retrieve its imdb id and send it to the EZTV API. This script will open the link once the data has been received.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
